I am an engineer at [Vironix Health](https://www.vironix.ai), a healthtech startup based in the US. My work entails ML research, data science, and backend engineering. Previously I was an M.Sc. student at the [Mathematical Institute](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/), University of Oxford, where I studied mathematical modelling & scientific computing. 

I intend on using this blog to share notes about what I'm learning.
